        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

            <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>

            <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>

            <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>

            <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
